# Your collegue wrote an simple loop to list his favourite animals. 
# But there seems to be a minor mistake in the grammar, which prevents the program to work. Fix it! :)
#If you pass the list of your favourite animals to the function, 
#you should get the list of the animals with orderings and newlines added.
